For this assignment, I developed a Staking Smart Contract that allows users to stake tokens, earn rewards, and withdraw their staked tokens and rewards. The contract was deployed on the Mumbai testnet, and a basic frontend interface was built to enable users to interact with the contract.

Key Tasks Completed
Smart Contract Development:

I created a smart contract using Solidity to manage staking, rewards, and withdrawals.
The contract included key features such as staking functionality, reward calculation, reward distribution, and withdrawal capabilities.
Frontend Development:

A basic frontend interface was built using web development technologies like HTML, JavaScript, and Web3.js.
This frontend allowed users to interact with the smart contract, stake tokens, and withdraw their staked tokens and rewards.
Testing:

I conducted comprehensive testing for the smart contract using Hardhat. Test cases were written to verify the correctness and robustness of the contract's functionality.
Deployment:

The Staking Smart Contract was deployed on the Mumbai testnet, and the contract address was provided in the word filw ass4.
